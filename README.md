# CS-151-Midterm-Project
For the midterm from my Object-Oriented Design class, I led a team of 4 to learn and understand the process to create a simulated voicemail system from the book "Object-Oriented Design and Patterns" by Cay Horstmann. I revised the project myself and implemented a slightly enhanced version. Compared to the original version, the new implementation has a new admin user who can create new extensions and change passwords of the existed extensions. Additionally, an extension owner can record multiple greetings and choose one to use. More details can be found in our team's Analysis Phase and my Design Phase.
